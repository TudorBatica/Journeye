# Journeye
A cross-platform mobile application for travel enthusiasts to share their adventures.
## Motivation
I want to build a platform dedicated to travelling, where people can share as much or as little as they like about their journeys.
## How does it work?
Users can post a so-called trip story which is basically a summary of their journey.  
I believe that users know what's best for them, that's why I want to give them the option to choose exactly how much they want to share with the world. To achieve this I intend to implement the following solution: a trip story has the following fields:  
..*title  
..* images  
..* locations (names of the place(s) that the user went to)  
..* cost (how much did everything cost)  
..* accommodation (links to where they stayed at)  
..* mode of transport (how did they get there?)  
In order for users to be able to post a trip story they will have the fill only the title and at least another field. So, you may have users that want to share only some photos and the names of the places they've been to, some who may not want even to name those places, some who may want to share a full review of their experience, etc.
